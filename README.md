#MiddleBoxPrinter


##Overview

This project is, for now, a simple packet spoofer/sniffer that 
sends out a bunch of packets to random packets. TTLs are 
modulated in an attempt to illicite distinguishing behavior
in middle boxes.

###NOTE
I might switch the code base to Golang at some point but for now we are
doing this thing in C FTW.
